Write a storyboard for a story based on the following topic: {story_seed}.
Format your answer as a numbered list from 0-{num_parts} with periods after each number.
Item 0 will contain both the title and description of the story.
They will be separated by a '/'.
The title will have max 8 words and the description will have max 30 words.
The title will start with: 'Ginger Cat ðŸ˜»', contain additional emojis, and be extremely simple and easy to understand.
The description will include appropriate hashtags at the end.
The storyboard will have {num_parts} parts, which are written as items 1-{num_parts}.
Each part will have a prompt for an AI image generation.
Make sure that the scenes are written with appropriate pacing so the story lasts 17 frames.
Each prompt will have the three following items in order:
Character(s) and their appearance and clothing,
Scene/location,
Action and emotion to be depicted.
Write the three items with / inbetween so you don't forget.
Do not include any labels such as "Prompt:" before each prompt.
